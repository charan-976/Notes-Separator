# Notes Seperator
Notes Seperator Project under Machine Learning and AI society of **Developer Students Club - IIT Patna**.

## Motivation
Generally, during exams we take many images from notes of other people to study from. And once exams are over, it is a tedious job to find each of the images again and delete them one by one from our gallery.
This is the very motivation for this project - To develop an algorithm that can classify a given image as "image from notes" and "image not from notes".

## Impact
This project will help students to automatically remove images of notes from there gallery automatically without the user looking for any particular image .

## Aim
The aim of the project is to autonomously detect whether a given image is taken from some notes or not. To achieve this, we will use **Convolutional Neural Networks** as our tool.
We will be using different CNN architectures and choose the one with maximum accuracy parameters.

* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* Basic python libraries used in ML ([Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)).

## Resources
Plenty of resources can be found at [this link](https://aquarius31.github.io/ml/).

## Dataset
The datset used for this model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=1aM19cJwlfLTzQnE8y6K-gdKuWfCyf0YC). 

## Further Works
Further we may deploy the model on Googleâ€™s API or make an app that will automatically detect such images and will remove from your phone.
